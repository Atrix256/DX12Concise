Just need to make a simple concise dx12 base.  

From there can start coding dx12 demos and things

dont need all of stb, could just get the headers you want

? why does there need to be per frame resources here, but not in prism?

? get rid of d3dx12.h?
? get rid of Win32Application.h / .cpp?
? get rid of pch?

* there is a com memory error on startup

* pass swapchain format as parameter to dx12 init

* a thing to binary compile assets?
