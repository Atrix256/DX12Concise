* make root signature use descriptor tables instead of a bunch of single SRVs!
 * make an enum for root signature usage?




Just need to make a simple concise dx12 base.  
ditch managers etc. simple.

From there can start coding dx12 demos and things

dont need all of stb, could just get the headers you want

? get rid of d3dx12.h?
? get rid of Win32Application.h / .cpp?
? get rid of pch?

* pass swapchain format as parameter to dx12 init
* also depth stencil format

* gut everything, simple 2d shape with ndotl lighting or something

* rename project, or re-create entirely :P

* maybe yes, use self releasing pointers in dx12.h so return false etc handles things correctly. at least in the initialization part?

* make demo respect whether dx12 init succeeds or not

* it would be nice if the app didn't have to deal with "what is the current frame index", but maybe the dx12 api would give you the right one to use

* dx12 tutorial says you need a constant buffer per frame. need to make something for that, or a streaming system to make them on demand as needed.

* there's messages on shutdown about leaked objects. look into that





? how do descriptor tables work in dx12?
 * do they even do anything on release?
 * when you set something, do they just create a new SRV at the already used heap location?

? why does there need to be per frame resources here? render target views that is. does it do it underneath?
